WEBSITE CONTENT REQUIREMENTS

Your website must include the following:
    • At least two HTML pages.
    • A description of yourself (for example: your college, major, hobbies, graduation date, etc.).
    • At least one photo (most likely of you, but you can choose a photo of a landscape or animal if you don’t feel comfortable including your face).
    • Your work/education experience (i.e., content from your resume).
    • Your contact information (e.g., email, LinkedIn, Github).

You may also include any other (appropriate) content. Here are some examples:
    • Your hobbies and personal interests: Made some cool art? Hiked a really steep mountain? Went kayaking with friends? Consider adding a description and photos to your site.
    • Your projects: Consider adding a description of your final course projects or any other personal projects you’ve worked on. You may also want to link to a GitHub repository with the code.
    • A news section/page: Cool things that have happened in your professional or personal life.

--- Technical Requirements -----

Your website must:
    • include necessary boilerplate in each HTML file (change the page title and description for each page).
    • use semantic HTML when appropriate (for example: use <header>, <main>, and <footer> instead of the generic <div>).
    • include well-written alt text for all images.
    • use either CSS flexbox or CSS grid to implement at least one design feature (e.g., a responsive navbar, page columns).
    • use at least one media query to make your website more responsive (e.g., change the number of columns on the page when viewed on a smaller device)
   
Note: Test your website on multiple browsers and at different window sizes. Make sure the styling works how you expect.

Host your website with GitHub pages. 

Your website will be graded with the following rubric:
